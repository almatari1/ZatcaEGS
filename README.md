# ZatcaEGS

ZatcaEGS (Zatca eInvoice Generation System) is an application designed to integrate [Manager-io](https://manager.io) with Fatoora Zatca eInvoice. This application aims to simplify the process of creating and reporting eInvoices.

## Using Without Manager.io

ZatcaEGS is designed for Manager.io, but you can use the **Zatca.eInvoice** library directly in your own app (no Manager). See **[STANDALONE_USAGE.md](STANDALONE_USAGE.md)** for:

- Using `Zatca.eInvoice` in your own .NET app (API, console, etc.)
- Running the **Zatca.StandaloneExample** console app (`dotnet run --project Zatca.StandaloneExample`)
- Device onboarding, building UBL invoices, signing, and calling ZATCA APIs yourself
